# big_data_cleaning_and_analysis
This is a repository for a project to Santander Coders, a scholarship by Santander and Ada to teach Data Engineering concepts and practice.

Here it will be focused concepts of data cleaning with pandas and numpy.

It was used a public dataset available in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arianazmoudeh/airbnbopendata) to work on this project.
